## Abstract
The Northeast Pacific is a highly heterogeneous and productive ecosystem, yet is vulnerable to climate change and extreme events such as marine heat waves. Recent die-offs of marine birds and declines in fisheries biomass in the Gulf of Alaska region were associated with the loss of large, lipid-rich copepods, which are a vital food resource for forage fishes. The critical role of copepods in this ecosystem, paired with their sensitivity to thermal variation, motivates our investigation into the impacts of temperature on patterns of copepod occurrence, abundance, and phenology. Here, we pair long term in situ copepod data from Continuous Plankton Recorder surveys with satellite remote sensing of ocean conditions to determine the influence of water temperature on three key copepod taxa: Neocalanus plumchrus, Calanus pacificus, and Oithona spp. Through the use of linear models and thermal threshold methods, we demonstrate that N. plumchrus is most vulnerable to warming and future marine heat waves in this region. Linear models demonstrated that N. plumchrus occurrence is negatively related to temperature, while thermal threshold methods revealed that N. plumchrus has an upper thermal threshold for occurrence of 11.5°C, and abundance of 10.5°C. While Oithona spp. and C. pacificus appear to be less vulnerable to warm temperatures, their presence will not be sufficient to supplement the loss of the large-bodied and lipid-rich N. plumchrus. Our findings demonstrate the power of using long-term in situ data to determine thermal tolerances, and suggest the need to further examine the potential resilience of N. plumchrus to climate change.
